# joint ops
entered wwii: military organization was incapable of coordinating land, sea, and air activities across its two military departments (war and navy)
1942 Rosevelt create the joint chiefs of staff (JCS)
during wwii: efforts sought to rectify the US military's disjointedness
national secuirty act of 1947
legislated revisions to the national security act in 1949, 1953, and 1958 attempted to mend these deficiencies
military departments retained a defacto role in the operational chain

## forces
global force manegement (GFM) is the process which allows the SecDef to strategically manage the employment of the force among the CCDRs. This is accomplished via three related processes: assignment, allocation, and apportionment.
assigns, allocates, apportions


## unified commands
joint forces are established by either geographic area or on functional basis
only GCCs are assigned areas of responsibility (AOR) 
geographic combatant commanders' forces can operate wherever they are required to acomplish their mission

the information environment (IE) is the aggregate of social, cultural, psychological, technical, and physical factors that affect how humans and automated systems derive meaning from, act upon, and are
impacted by information, including the individuals, organization, and systems that collect, process, disseminate, or use information

physical aspcets are the material characteristics, both natural and manufactured, of the environment that may inhibit or enhace communication. physical aspects mare create constrains and freedoms on the people and information systems that operate in it. physical aspects are critical elements of group identity and impact how groups form, disperse or cease to exist

information aspects reflect the way that individuals, information systems and groups communicate and exchange information. information aspects are the sensory inputs (e.g., content, medium, format, and context) of activities that a receiver interprets and uses to assign meaning.

human aspects are the interactions amoung and between people and the environment that shape human behavior and decision making. those interactions are base upon the linguistic, social, cultural, psychological, and physical elements.


operations in the IE (OIE) are military actions involving the integrated employment of multiple information forces to affect drivers of behavior by informing audiences; influencing foreign relevant actors; attacking and exploiting relevant actor information, information networks, and information systems; and protecting friendly information, information networks, and information systems.

Informaiton advantage
Informational Power


The elevation of information as a joint function impacts all operations and signals a fundamental appreciation for the military role of information at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels within today's complex OE.


Assessment of information in joint operations are conducted in accordance with the operation assessment process.


Information forces aggregate military personnel, weapon systems, equipment, and necessary support that provide expertise and specialized capabilities (e.g., CMO, MISO, PA, EMSO, CO) that leverage infomation conduct activities.


joint organizations: there are multiple joit organizations that provide support to the joint force and leveraging information

USG organizations: effective integration of the appropriate USG organizations will enhavnce the overal success of the jiont force operations. there are a multitude of organizations inside and outsied DOD that are relevant to the joint force management and application of informations


public affairs planners advice the JFC on the possible direct and indirect effects of joint force actions aon public perceptions

civil-military operations activities include military government; support to civil administration; populace and resources control; FHA; foreign assistance; and overseas humanitarian, disasters and civic aid appropriation.

military information support operations have strategic, operationsal, and tactical applications and are a critical informationsal/infuence capability employed as a part of OIE across the competition continuum

military deception deception requires a thorough knowledge of the enemy and their decision-making processes


comcam is not listed as an information force, comcam imagery supports capabilities that use imagery for their products and efforts, including MISO, MILDEC, PA, and CMO

cyberspace operations employ cyberspace capabilities to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace: OCO, DCO, DODIN

space operations, cornerstone responsibilities of military space forces are to preserve freedom of action, enable joint lethality and effectiveness, and provide national leadership

operational secuity the process of protecting critical information wheter classified or unclassified that can be used against us. preventing adversaries' access to information and action that may compromise and operation. look through the eyes of the enemy to prevent their ability to take action

because a specified task is 'to protect our own' information, opsec panners require complete situational awareness, regarding friendly activities to facilitate the safeguarding of critical information and indicators

special technical operations(STO): commanders should deconflict and synchronize other activities with STO. STO action officers at CCMD or service component HQs can provide military and civilian ledership with detailed information related to STO and its contribution to joint force operations

Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations: JEMSO actions to exploit, attack, protect, and manage the electromagnetic environment rely on personnel and systems from EW, EMS management, intelligence, space, and cyberspace mission areas

key leader engagement: most operations require commanders and other leaders to conduct KLEs with key local and regional leaders to affect their attitudes, gain their support, and cltivate them as sources of information. Building relationships to the point of effective military engagement and influence usually takes time.
